                    <p>Let's go way back to the very beginning of society. When humans first started out, there weren't
                        very many
                        opportunities for trade. Evidence suggests that early man did a lot of wandering around, and
                        didn't settle into
                        society until fairly recently (on a galactic time-scale anyway). But once humans started to
                        develop societies and
                        grow, trade was possible.</p>
                    <p>With lots of people in a close enough space, like a village or town, people could learn to
                        specialize in their
                        craft. Potters could improve their pottery, and farmers could improve their agriculture
                        techniques. However pretty
                        quickly, early human societies ran into an issue called the <em>Coincidence of Wants</em>.</p>
                    <p>Let's say that I make pots, and you grow food. As long as I need food AND you need pots, we have
                        reason to trade.
                        But if you don't need pots anymore, then I am not able to buy any food off you. Wouldn't it be
                        useful if there were
                        a third good that we could use, one where we both agree upon the value?</p>
                    <p>This is where money comes in. Money is just a third good that doesn't spoil or go out of date,
                        and we all agree has
                        the same value. This makes it a unit of exchange, and a means by which all other goods can be
                        traded.</p>

                    <p>We often think of gold or silver when it comes to money, but historically, humans have used a
                        lot of weird stuff as
                        money. For a while, we used cows as money. They're somewhat durable, they last for a while, and
                        can be turned into
                        meat or milked. They're also reasonable scarce, an important characteristic of money.
                        Cigarettes are often used as
                        currency in prisons. And when Europeans first found the Americas, alcohol was used as money.</p>
                    <p>This kind of money is called <em>commodity money</em> because the money itself has a use. To
                        quote <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_money">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
                    <blockquote>Commodity money consists of objects that have value in themselves as well as value in
                        their use as money.</blockquote>
                    <p>A useful attribute of commodity money is that it doesn't require a central authority or
                        government to control it. If
                        civilization in Britain falls apart tomorrow, and the Bank of England collapses, cows will
                        still hold their value.
                        Now, we're not saying that in a post-Brexit world the UK would actually revert to trading in
                        cows rather than
                        pounds. We're just using it as an illustration.</p>

                    <p>The problem with commodity money is that it limits the potential growth that a society can have.
                        If your society is
                        using cows as a currency, then the amount of money in your society has an upper limit based on
                        the number of cows
                        you can reasonably fit within that society.</p>
                    <p>Another issue is that commodity money is heavy. The going rate for a <a href="https://www.gulfstream.com/aircraft/gulfstream-g650er">Gulfstream
                            G650ER Private Jet</a> is around $66.5 million United States Dollars. If you were to pay
                        for that in gold, you
                        would have to shift 1462KG of the stuff (or 3225lbs). Transactions that size just don't scale
                        very well with
                        commodity money.</p>
                    <p>A way around this is to give people the ability to exchange their commodity money for an IOU. An
                        IOU (pronounced <em>I
                            owe you</em>) is just a piece of paper with a promise to pay a person an amount of stuff.
                        An IOU doesn't
                        necessarily have to document the repayment of money though.</p>
                    <p><img src="img/what-is-fiat-currency/iou.jpg" alt="An example of an IOU." /></p>
                    <p>This method was used in ancient China. The Chinese government was buying a lot of things, and
                        the royal accountants
                        were having a hard time dealing with all the gold coins moving around. So to help matters, they
                        started paying
                        people using pieces of paper with the amount of money owed on them. The holder of the paper
                        could go to the palace
                        and redeem the paper for the amount of gold printed on it.</p>
                    <p><img src="img/what-is-fiat-currency/china-iou.jpg" alt="The first known usage of paper money." /></p>
                    <p>These papers started being circulated all throughout China. Soon, merchants realized that these
                        slips of paper were
                        always good since they could be returned to the capital for however much was written on them
                        whenever they wanted.
                        So why bother turning them in at all? They could just use the slips of paper to purchase
                        things!</p>
                    <p>This paper money can be called Fiat currency. The paper that is used is not inherently valuable.
                        It only has value
                        because of the promise from the government to refund it as gold when requested.</p>

                    <p>This moves us onto the idea of cryptocurrency, which is even less valuable than fiat currency
                        since it has no
                        physical attributes. You can't touch or hold cryptocurrency, you can only ever change its
                        ownership. But unlike
                        fiat currency, cryptocurrency doesn't require a centralized bank or organization to manage the
                        value of the money.
                        Cryptocurrency has both the decentralization of commodity money and the convenience of fiat
                        money.</p>
