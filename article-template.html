                        to blockchain development. So we've put together this page to help explain some of the concepts as

Or is it just something web devs have been throwing at the bottom of their sites because all the other web devs do it? Just seems weird to me. Also, this entire site design was ripped from one of the default Bootstrap 4 templates. Thanks to those guys at Twitter for sorting us out.</p>
