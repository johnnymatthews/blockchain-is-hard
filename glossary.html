                    ya-yas from Ikea. You have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less, so...

                    you
                    come home at the end of the day and throw your jacket on a chair? Yeah. Well, instead of a jacket,
                    it's
                    a pile of garbage. And instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of the end of the

                    it's the end of time and garbage is all that has survived. I'm not so good with the advice. Can I

                legally binding? Like,
                does this section actually mean anything? Or is it just something web devs have
                been throwing at the
                bottom of their sites because all the other web devs do it? Just seems weird to me.
                Also, this entire
                site design was ripped from one of the default Bootstrap 4 templates. Thanks to
                those guys at Twitter
                for sorting us out.</p>
