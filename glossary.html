                                the card. Addresses work the same way in Aion. If you friend wants to send you some

                                Each address is unique, and is 66 characters long. Every single Aion address starts

                            <p class="item-body">A decentralized application. Regular applications like Netflix and
                                Wikipedia generally have two points of contact, your computer and their servers.
                                <br>
                                This is what happens when you want to view an article on Wikipedia:
                                <br>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>You click on a link to view an article.</li>
                                    <li>The Wikipedia receives your request.</li>
                                    <li>It searches for the article.</li>
                                    <li>It send the article back to you.</li>
                                    <li>Your computer shows it on the screen.</li>
                                </ol>
                                <br>
                                This is how the majority of the internet works. You request something from a server,
                                and the server sends it back to you. There are a lot of problems with this method. For
                                example, if someone wanted you to see an edited version of the article, all they have
                                to do is change it on the Wikipedia server.
                                <br>
                                In a Dapp the user asks a network of computers for the article, and they collectively
                                respond with all the data. This way the user can be 100% sure that the article they are
                                getting back is completely correct, since every single computer on the network has to
                                send the exact same article. If one of the computers tries to change the article, all
                                the other computers will disagree and kick that computer from the network.

                                dollars are fiat currency, as is gold and silver. Cigarettes are often used in prison
                                as fiat currency. It is essentially just something that a collection of people regard
                                as having value.

                            <p class="item-body">Having two things that are exactly the same in value. A single $10
                                bill has exactly the same value as two $5 bills. It's the same with most
                                cryptocurrencies. My Bitcoin (1BTC) has the exact same value as your Bitcoin (1BTC).
                                Another word for this is interchangeable.
                                <br>
                                The opposite of this is non-fungible, which means the opposite. Non-fungible is when
                                two things don't have the same value. My bottle of wine is worth $30, but yours is
                                older and from a more prestigious vineyard, so it's worth $100.

                                building a wall, they must place the first brick and secure it in place before moving
                                onto the next brick. When the builder has finished building the wall, every single
                                brick on the wall can be traced back to the original brick.

                                In a similar was, every single block on the Aion blockchain can be traced back to the
                                genesis block. Knowing where the genesis block is, or what was on it, isn't really
                                important for day to day Dapp development.

                                help it run on a blockchain network.
