                            <p>It stands for Application Binary Interface. An ABI is always linked to an application, and it essentially describes what that application does. It acts as a map of the application so that other programs can refer to the map rather than searching through the application itself.</p>

                                <p>Imagine it's your birthday and your friend wants to send you a birthday card. They need to know what your house address is before they can send you the card. Addresses work the same way in Aion. If your friend wants to send you some AION, they need to know your address. Each address is unique and is 66 characters long. Every single Aion address starts with 0xa. They look like this:</p>
                            <p><code>0xa08091ab0325e384ac45e560d2f85e4b741363aa98881d52d54233a02b33fcaa</code></p>
                            <p>On top of being required for sending and receiving money, addresses are used to store programs. Say I had an application that multiplied two numbers together and gave you the result back. You would need to send two numbers to my application's address.</p>

                            <p>Computers aren't very good at understanding human language. When they get given a bunch of code, they have to translate it into simple instructions before they can do anything with it. Once they have a step by step guide on what to do, then they can actually run the code.</p>
                            <p>Byte code is a bunch of instructions that a computer can understand. It's not designed to be easy for a human to read (it actually looks super confusing), but that's not the point. It's designed to be as efficient as possible for the computer to understand.</p>
                            <p>When a program gets compiled with Aion, it gets translated into byte code. This code is then run by other computers on the network. Again, this code isn't designed to be understood easily by humans. It's designed to be super easy for computers to understand.</p>

                            <p>A decentralized application. Regular applications like Netflix and Wikipedia generally has two points of contact, your computer, and their servers.</p>
                            <p>This is what happens when you want to view an article on Wikipedia: 
                                <ul>
                                    <li>You click on a link to view an article.</li>
                                    <li>The Wikipedia receives your request.</li>
                                    <li>It searches for the article in the Wikipedia database.</li>
                                    <li>It sends the article back to you.</li>
                                    <li>Your computer shows it on the screen.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>
                            <p>This is how the majority of the internet works. There are some differences between server technologies and new browser processes, but this is basically what everything boils down to. You request something from a server, and the server sends it back to you.</p>
                            <p>There are some problems with this method, mainly about making sure the data you receive is correct. For example, if someone wanted you to see an edited version of an article, all they have to do is change it on the Wikipedia server. There is no way to guarantee that what you are reading is the correct, unaltered article. Some of you may point out that there is a section at the bottom of each Wikipedia article that states when it was last edited, which is correct. But how do you know that the <i>last edited</i> section hasn't also be altered by a hacker covering their tracks?</p>
                            <p>In a decentralized application, the user asks a large network of computers for the article, and they collectively respond with all the data. This way the user can be 100% sure that the article they are getting back is completely correct since every single computer on the network has to send the exact same article. If one of the computers tries to change the article, all the other computers will disagree with the change, and it will be obvious that something isn't quite right.</p>

This is different to a standard organization, where the power to make decisions is held by one Cheif Executive Officer (CEO), or a board of Directors.</p>
                            <p>Organizations that use a set of pre-programmed rules can react to changes and issues much faster (sometimes instantly) than standard organizations.</p>
                            <p>It's pronounced <i>d-aw-w</i>, apparently. Also, this is not to be confused with <b>The DAO</b>.

                            <p>People on a blockchain can send each other money. This is known as a transaction. In most transactions, the only thing that's moving around is money or cryptocurrency. But sometimes people will add some extra data to the transaction. This can be something like a reference for the payment, or a thank you note, or just a bunch of random letters and numbers. The purpose of the extra data field is not fixed, and users can do whatever they want with it.
                            <p>The special thing about this field is that it's permanent. Once a transaction has happened on a blockchain network, it is public information, and anyone can view the transaction forever. This can be useful for recording events.</p>
                            <p>For example: say Alice lent Bob some money to buy a drink. Alice and Bob could make an agreement stating that Bob needs to pay Alice $5 in one week. When that time arrives, Bob can create a transaction and sent it over to Alice. To make things clearer, Bob can put "Repayment for the drink last week" in the extra data field. That way, anyone who looks at this transaction in the future can see what it was for.</p>

                            <p>The opposite of this is non-fungible, which means the opposite. This is when two things don't have the same value. My bottle of wine is worth $30, but yours is older and from a more prestigious vineyard, so it's worth $100.

                            <p>This is the very first block on a blockchain. When a builder is building a wall, they must place the first brick and secure it in place before moving onto the next brick. When the builder has finished building the wall, every single brick on the wall can be traced back to the original brick.</p>
                            <p>In a similar way, every single block on the Aion blockchain can be traced back to the genesis block. Knowing where the genesis block is, or what was on it, isn't really important for day to day Dapp development. But it is useful to figure out how old a particular block is. If you know when the genesis block was made, and how far away the current block is from the genesis block, you can figure out how old the current block is.</p>

                            <p>A nonce is a <b>N</b>umber that is only used <b>once</b>. In cryptocurrency, it's used by miners to guess the solution to a math problem. Sounds a bit odd, but let us explain.
                            </p>
                            <p>For miners to get a reward, they have to solve an <i>incredibly</i> difficult mathematic
                                problem. This problem has a single answer. The problem is so difficult that it would
                                take an incredibly long time for a single computer to find the solution, but a few
                                hundred computers can usually find the answer pretty quickly.</p>
                            <p>Imagine that the miners had to figure out which number, when multiplied by 9, makes 36.
                                A miner could start guessing which number is the correct answer. They'd start at 1, but
                                figure out that <code>1 x 9 = 9</code>. So then they'd give 2 a go, but find out that
                                <code>2 x 9 = 18</code>. So they'd try 3, but find <code>3 x 9 = 27</code>. Finally
                                they'd try <code>4 x 9</code> and get the answer 36. This is the answer that the miners
                                were looking for, so that makes 36 the nonce.</p>

                            <h3 class="item-name">NRG</h3>
                            <p>When you go to the post office to deliver a parcel, you need to pay
                                the post office clerk money to deliver the parcel. How much money depends on how big
                                the parcel is, where it is going, and how fast you want it to get there.</p>
                            <p>NRG and blockchain networks work in a similar way, except instead of a parcel, there is
                                a transaction. And instead of a post office clerk, there is a blockchain miner. You ask
                                the miner to put your transaction on the blockchain. They look at it, figure out how
                                much work it will take them to do that, and then ask you for a fee. Once you pay the
                                fee, they take your transaction and put it on the blockchain.</p>
                            <p>In this case, the <i>fee</i> is NRG, which is a fancy way of saying very small amount of
                                <code>Aion</code> coin.</p>

                            <p>Just like every human has a biological parent, every single block in a
                                blockchain has a parent. Block #5 was preceded by block #4, and block #3 came before
                                that, and so on. This goes all the way back to block #1, also called the genesis block.
                                That bit's pretty simple. The parent of a block is the block that came before it.</p>
                            <p>The hash part is something different. When a block is put together, a complicated math
                                equation is ran against it, which gives us a bunch of numbers and letters. These
                                numbers and letters (called a <i>hash</i>) look random, but they can actually be used to find
                                out what information the block contains. Every single block has a <i>hash</i>
                                associated with it, and each hash is exactly the same length (they all have the same
                                amount of letters and numbers). Also, each block has a completely unique hash. No two
                                blocks will ever have the same hash.</p>

                does this section actually mean anything? Or is it just something web devs have been throwing at the
                bottom of their sites because all the other web devs do it? Just seems weird to me. Also, this entire
                site design was ripped from one of the default Bootstrap 4 templates. Thanks to those guys at Twitter
                for sorting us out. Oh yeah, and thanks to the Aion Foundation for letting us make this site on company
                time. Totally a worthwhile investment cheers Mike.</p>
