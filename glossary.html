                                ABI is always linked to an application, and it essentially describes what that
                                application does. It acts like a map of the application, so that other programs can
                                refer to the <i>map</i> rather than searching through the application itself.</p>

                            <p class="item-body">Imagine it's your birthday and your friend wants to send you a
                                birthday card. They need to know what your house address is before they can send you
                                the card. Addresses work the same way in Aion. If your friend wants to send you some
                                AION, they need to know your address.

                                Each address is unique, and is 66 characters long. Every single Aion address starts
                                with 0xa. They look like this:</p>
                            <p><code>0xa08091ab0325e384ac45e560d2f85e4b741363aa98881d52d54233a02b33fcaa</code></p>
                            <p>On top of being required for sending an receiving money, addresses are used to store
                                programs. Say I had an application that multiplied two numbers together and gave you
                                the result back. You would need to send two numbers to my application's address.</p>

                            <p class="item-body">A decentralized application. Regular applications like Netflix and
                                Wikipedia generally has two points of contact, your computer, and their servers.
                                <br>
                                This is what happens when you want to view an article on Wikipedia:
                                <br>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>You click on a link to view an article.</li>
                                    <li>The Wikipedia receives your request.</li>
                                    <li>It searches for the article.</li>
                                    <li>It send the article back to you.</li>
                                    <li>Your computer shows it on the screen.</li>
                                </ol>
                                <br>
                                This is how the majority of the internet works. You request something from a server,
                                and the server sends it back to you. There are a lot of problems with this method. For
                                example, if someone wanted you to see an edited version of the article, all they have
                                to do is change it on the Wikipedia server.
                                <br>
                                In a decentralized application, the user asks a network of computers for the article,
                                and they collectively respond with all the data. This way the user can be 100% sure
                                that the article they are getting back is completely correct since every single
                                computer on the network has to send the exact same article. If one of the computers
                                tries to change the article, all
                                the other computers will disagree and kick that computer from the network.

                            <p class="item-body">People on a blockchain can send each other money. This is known as a transaction. In most transactions, the only thing that's moving around is money or cryptocurrency. But sometimes people will add some <i>extra data</i> onto the transaction. This can be something like a reference for the payment, or a thank you note, or just a bunch of random letters and numbers. The purpose of the <i>extra data</i> field is not fixed, and users can do whatever they want with it.</p>
                            <p>The special thing about this field is that it's permanent. Once a transaction has happened on a blockchain network, it is public information, and anyone can view the transaction forever. This can be useful for recording events.</p>
                            <p>For example: say Alice lent Bob some money to buy a drink. Alice and Bob could make a contract stating that Bob needs to pay Alice $5 in one week. When that time arrives, Bob can create a transaction and sent it over to Alice on the blockchain. To make things clearer, Bob can put "Repayment for the drink last week" in the <i>extra data</i> field. That way, anyone who looks at this transaction in the future can see what it was for.</p>

                            <p class="item-body">Fiat currency is physical things people use to trade. United States
                                dollars are a fiat currency, as is gold and silver. Cigarettes are often used in prison
                                as fiat currency. It is essentially just something that a collection of people regard
                                as having value.

                            <p class="item-body">Having two things that are exactly the same in value. A single $10
                                bill has exactly the same value as two $5 bills. It's the same with most
                                cryptocurrencies. My Bitcoin (1BTC) has the exact same value as your Bitcoin (1BTC).
                                Another word for this is interchangeable.
                                <br>
                                The opposite of this is non-fungible, which means the opposite. Non-fungible is when
                                two things don't have the same value. My bottle of wine is worth $30, but yours is
                                older and from a more prestigious vineyard, so it's worth $100.

                                onto the next brick. When the builder has finished building the wall, every single
                                brick on the wall can be traced back to the original brick.

                                In a similar way, every single block on the Aion blockchain can be traced back to the

                            <p class="item-body">A nonce is a <b>N</b>umber that is only used <b>once</b>. In blockchain, it's used by miners to guess the solution to a math problem. Sounds a bit odd, but let us explain.</p>
                            <p>For miners to get a reward, they have to solve an <i>incredibly</i> difficult mathematic problem. This problem has a single answer. The problem is so difficult that it would take an incredibly long time for a single computer to find the solution, but a few hundred computers can usually find the answer pretty quickly.</p>
                            <p>Imagine that the miners had to figure out which number, when multiplied by 9, makes 36. A miner could start guessing which number is the correct answer. They'd start at 1, but figure out that <code>1 x 9 = 9</code>. So then they'd give 2 a go, but find out that <code>2 x 9 = 18</code>. So they'd try 3, but find <code>3 x 9 = 27</code>. Finally they'd try <code>4 x 9</code> and get the answer 36. This is the answer that the miners were looking for, so that makes 36 the nonce.</p>

                            <p class="item-body">When you go to the post office to deliver a parcel, you need to pay the post office clerk money to deliver the parcel. How much money depends on how big the parcel is, where it is going, and how fast you want it to get there.</p>
                            <p>NRG and blockchain networks work in a similar way, except instead of a parcel, there is a transaction. And instead of a post office clerk, there is a blockchain miner. You ask the miner to put your transaction on the blockchain. They look at it, figure out how much work it will take them to do that, and then ask you for a fee. Once you pay the fee, they take your transaction and put it on the blockchain.</p>
                            <p>In this case, the <i>fee</i> is NRG, which is a fancy way of saying very small amount of <code>Aion</code> coin.</p>

                does this section actually mean anything? Or is it just something web devs have been throwing at the
                bottom of their sites because all the other web devs do it? Just seems weird to me. Also, this entire
                site design was ripped from one of the default Bootstrap 4 templates. Thanks to those guys at Twitter
                for sorting us out. Oh yeah, and thanks to the Aion Foundation for letting us make this site on company
                time. Totally a worthwhile investment cheers Mike.</p>
