                legally binding? Like,
                does this section actually mean anything? Or is it just something web devs have
                been throwing at the
                bottom of their sites because all the other web devs do it? Just seems weird to me.
                Also, this entire
                site design was ripped from one of the default Bootstrap 4 templates. Thanks to
                those guys at Twitter
                for sorting us out.</p>
