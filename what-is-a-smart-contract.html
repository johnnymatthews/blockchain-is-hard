                            The Basics
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            Smart contracts are electronic contracts that happen
                            automatically when certain conditions are met. They
                            are an attempt to fix the biggest problem with a lot
                            of industries: people.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For the majority of companies, people are the most
                            expensive component. They make mistakes, they get
                            sick, they forget things, sometimes they're
                            dishonest, and they cost a lot of money. In fact for
                            the majority of companies, the biggest outgoing cost
                            is labor. Smart contracts cut out the human aspects
                            of a lot of industries and can streamline repetitive
                            processes.

                        <p>
                            When you buy a house the process goes something like
                            this:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>You gather your money together and give it to a broker.</li>
                                <li>
                                    The broker checks the amount of money and gives it to the homeowner in exchange for the house, after taking a cut of the money.
                                </li>
                                    <li>The broker gives you the keys.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </p>
                        <p>There are lots of ways things can go wrong:</p>
                        <p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The money could get lost.</li>
                                <li>The homeowner could claim to not receive the money.</li>
                                <li>The broker could run off with the money.</li>
                                <li>The broker and the seller could work together to change the amount of money that the buyer agreed to pay.</li>
                                <li>The broker and the buyer could disappear, leaving you with no money and no house!</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>In most countries, there are checks and procedures in place to stop these kinds of things happening. But they are usually very manual processes that take a lot of time and cost a lot of money. And again, you're placing your trust in people! This may all be fine if you live in a country with little corruption, but if you don't then this becomes a huge issue.</p>

                        <h2 id="how-smart-contracts-can-help">How Smart Contracts Can Help</h2>
                        <h3>First off, they remove the middle man.</h3>
                        <p>Instead of transferring the money to a broker, you would transfer it to a Smart Contract. All smart contracts can act as a bank account and hold money. They are programmed in a way to only release the money when certain conditions are met. For example, if you never receive the keys from the home-owner, then the smart contract will not release the money to the home-owner. If after 30 days you still haven't received the keys, then the money is returned back to you.</p>
                        <h3>Second, they can't be changed.</h3>
                        <p>Once a smart contract is uploaded to a network, it is shared with hundreds of people around the world. If someone wanted to change the contract, they would have to edit hundreds of copies of the same contract! For example, if the home-owner wanted to change the contract to say that you owed them double the amount that you originally agreed upon, then they'd have to change the amount owed on every single copy of the contract. The difficulty required to do this is so massive, that it's not worth doing it.</p>
                        <p>Also, the outcome of the contract is permanent too. If they home-owner claims that they never received all the money from the contract, anyone can take a look at the transaction records to see what happened. It's impossible for smart contracts to lie.</p>
                        <h3>Lastly, they can be programmed to do pretty much anything!</h3>
                        <p>Our original example of buying and selling a house is pretty simple, but in reality, there's a lot of other things that happen too! Say the house was up for auction, and there were several home-owners of the house that the money needed to be split between. Well, a smart contract could:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Find the winning bidder.</li>
                            <li>Receive their money automatically.</li>
                            <li>Figure out how much each home-owner is owed (they might not all have equal shares, and this could be complicated to do by hand).</li>
                            <li>Transfer the money to the home-owners.</li>
                            <li>File a change of deed with the government to have the winning bidder become the legal owner of the house.</li>
                            <li>Pay the housing tax automatically, on behalf of the new-owner.</li>
                            <li>File a tax-rebate for the old home-owners if they are owed one.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>While this is impressive on its own, keep in mind that this type of transaction happens hundreds of times a day. The amount of time and money that goes into figuring all this out manually is staggering!</p>

                        <p>Smart contracts can be used in pretty much every industry on the planet! They can:</p>
                        <p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>be used to help track parcels and shipping items.</li>
                                <li>help ensure the safe transportation of medical goods.</li>
                                <li>keep 100% accurate history of the ownership of restricted items like guns of hazardous chemicals.</li>
                                <li>speed up the processing times for real estate or legal contracts.</li>
                                <li>make it easier and cheaper to transfer money between accounts.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>The list goes on and on. By using smart contracts, the world can cut down on middle-man costs, and start spending resources on things that really matter!</p>

                    site design was ripped from one of the default Bootstrap 4
                    templates. Thanks to those guys at Twitter for sorting us
                    out. Oh yeah, and thanks to the Aion Foundation for letting
                    us make this site on company time. Totally a worthwhile
                    investment, cheers Mike.
