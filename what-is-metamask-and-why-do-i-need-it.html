                    <p>Blockchain development is in its very early stages right now, so programmers are creating applications and solutions that just <i>do-the-job-for-now</i>. That is to say, some of these things won't be around forever, and they're just acting as a stop-gap until the community figures out what to do next.</p>
                    <p>Metamask is one of these solutions, a bridge between where we are now, and where we want to be in a few years.</p>

                    <p>When you go to a website that is connected to a blockchain, the website expects every user to also be connected to the blockchain. Most internet browsers (like Chrome or Firefox) do not have any built-in blockchain capabilities yet, but this will likely change in the future. In order to bridge this gap, users need to install Metamask, a browser extension that allows the browser to communicate with the blockchain.</p>
                    <p>Another thing that Metamask can do is act as a crypto-wallet (a digital wallet that holds your cryptocurrency). This is handy since it removes the need to install complicated desktop wallet software.</p>

                does this section actually mean anything? Or is it just something web devs have been throwing at the
                bottom of their sites because all the other web devs do it? Just seems weird to me. Also, this entire
                site design was ripped from one of the default Bootstrap 4 templates. Thanks to those guys at Twitter
                for sorting us out. Oh yeah, and thanks to the Aion Foundation for letting us make this site on company
                time. Totally a worthwhile investment, cheers Mike.</p>
