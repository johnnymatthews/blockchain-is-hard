# Blockchain Is Hard

It's pretty much all in the title really. Blockchain is hard. So we've thrown together this site to help people understand blockchain concepts. We're aiming for every article to be self-contained, and so that the readers don't have to read other parts of the site first. We're also trying to not use any acronyms. Acronyms are dumb.
